## Kaggle
- [Titanic - Machine Learning from disaster](https://github.com/JAMorello/data-science-exercises/tree/master/Kaggle/Titanic)
  
  This is a competition in Kaggle, the first challenge for newcommers to dive into ML competitions and familiarize 
  themselves with how the platform works. The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts 
  which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. Link to the competition overview: [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
  Here I use Pandas, Seaborn, y scikit-learn. This project consisted of:
    - visual analysis of data
    - feature engineering
    - initializing and training of prediction models (highest prob.: 0.830527)
    - hyperparameter tuning using grid search (highest prob: 0.833895)
    - outputing and submiting predictions to Kaggle platform (score: 0.78947)
